Hi guys! i will show yo how to up docker with yii2 in your company project!
Firstly, Should to add localhost in your own "system32 host" i will drop it downstairs.

1)If you use Window copy localhost then,you should open C:\Windows\System32\drivers\hosts -> put inside hosts file
127.0.0.1   backend.tmp.loc
127.0.0.1   frontend.tmp.loc

2) git clone
3) open terminal cd desktop cd docker-yii2, docker-compose up --build enter
4) docker ls   <-  this command show you status docker it works or not

thats all thanks!
